/**
 @brief Base class for drawable nodes in a scene
 
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 
 The ICNode class represents a drawable object on a scene graph. A scene graph is usually rooted
 in an ICScene object. Each node has an array of children nodes and a weak reference to its
 parent node.
 
 A node has a transform matrix used to transform coordinates from parent space to its own
 local space. Nodes provide convenience methods for manipulating their transform matrix based
 on ICNode::position, ICNode::scale, rotation (ICNode::getRotationAngle:axis:,
 ICNode::setRotationAngle:axis:) and ICNode::anchorPoint properties. Furthermore, nodes provide
 methods for calculating inverse and world transforms.
 
 Nodes have implicit order, that is, their order is defined by the index they occupy in their
 parent's children array. ICNode provides convenience methods for manipulating this order, e.g.
 ICNode::orderFront, ICNode::orderForward, ICNode::orderBackward and ICNode::orderBack.
 
 Visitors are used to traverse a given scene graph for drawing on a frame buffer. A visitor is
 an external object of class ICNodeVisitor. The framework ships with two built-in visitor classes,
 ICNodeVisitorDrawing for drawing nodes on screen and ICNodeVisitorPicking for drawing nodes
 on an invisible framebuffer for picking.
 
 Since IcedCoffee is based on GLES2, each node uses shader programs for drawing. Shader programs
 are managed using the ICShaderProgram and ICShaderCache classes.
 
 Nodes provide the basis for user interaction event handling for mice, touch, and keyboard
 devices. Event handling is implemented on top of the scene graph in the ICScene, ICResponder, and
 ICHostViewController classes amongst others.

 <h3>Subclassing</h3>
 
 ICNode may be subclassed to implement custom nodes. Most likely, you will want to implement
 custom drawing and/or custom event handling (based on ICResponder.)
 
 <h4>Custom Drawing</h4>
 
 <ul>
    <li>ICNode's designated initializer is ICNode::init. You should override ICNode::init
    to implement custom initialization on top of ICNode.</li>
    <li>Set a custom shader program in the subclasses' initializer if necessary.</li>
    <li>ICNode::drawWithVisitor: is called by the framework when the node needs to be drawn into
    a framebuffer. It is used for both drawing and picking.</li>
    <li>When you override ICNode::drawWithVisitor:, first check whether the node is visible and
    skip any drawing if it is not.</li>
    <li>IcedCoffee does by default provide two different visitors. ICNodeVisitorDrawing is
    used for rendering objects on screen while ICNodeVisitorPicking is used to draw objects
    on an internal picking frame buffer. ICNode provides a standard way of setting up shaders
    for drawing and picking. Hence, after checking for visibility, you should call
    ICNode::applyStandardDrawSetupWithVisitor: . This will automatically activate the node's shader
    program for drawing or the default picker shader program for picking.</li>
    <li>You may implement custom picking shapes or optimized drawing code for picking by checking
    the class of the visitor object given when ICNode::drawWithVisitor: is called. If visitor is
    kind of class ICNodeVisitorDrawing, provide code to draw the object's visible shape on screen.
    If visitor is kind of class ICNodeVisitorPicking, provide code to draw the object's
    pickable shape.</li>
    <li>You may also implement your drawing code without taking care of picking. In this
    case the framework will automatically use the object's drawn shape as a picking shape
    provided that you employ ICNode::applyStandardDrawSetupWithVisitor: to set up drawing.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h4>Custom Event Handling</h4>
 
 <ul>
    <li>Event handling is based on the ICResponder super class. You implement event handlers
    by overriding one of the event handler methods defined there, e.g. by implementing
    ICResponder::mouseDown:. You may override both touch and mouse event handler methods in one
    ICNode subclass. On Mac OS X the node will receive mouse events and on iOS it will receive
    touch events.</li>
    <li>By default, events received but not handled by your node will be passed on to the next
    responder in the responder chain. The next responder is by default set to the parent of the
    node. You may choose to override this default by implementing ICNode::init and setting
    ICResponder::nextResponder to some other object. You may suppress event forwarding by
    implementing the respective event handler with an empty body in your subclass. If you
    implement a certain event handler method for performing a specific task, you may choose to
    pass the event to the next responder by calling the respective event method on
    <code>self.nextResponder</code> at the end of your method implementation.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Popular Subclasses</h3>
 
 IcedCoffee provides a number of 'popular' subclasses of ICNode that are equipped with special
 capabilities which you may find useful.
 
 <ul>
    <li>ICSprite renders a textured 2D quad.</li>
    <li>ICRenderTexture serves as a low-level FBO. It renders a sub scene into a texture and
    displays that texture on screen utilizing ICSprite.</li>
    <li>ICView provides a view hierarchy based on render textures (using ICRenderTexture.)</li>
    <li>ICControl provides user interface control capabilities on top of ICView.</li>
 </ul>

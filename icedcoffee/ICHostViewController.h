/**
 @brief View controller base class for displaying and updating an IcedCoffee framebuffer
 
 <h3>Overview</h3>
 
 ICHostViewController defines a view controller for platform-specific views (host views.)
 The class provides the following main functionality:
 <ul>
    <li><b>Rendering OpenGL scenes</b>: the class renders an ICScene object defined
    by a call to ICHostViewController::runWithScene: when the application is initialized.
    It uses a CoreVideo (Mac) or CoreAnimation (iOS) display link callback to perform
    frame updates continuously, synchronized to the refresh rate of the device's display.</li>
    <li><b>Scheduling updates for animations</b>: [TODO]</li>
    <li><b>Dispatching HID events</b>: HID events are dispatched to the scene rendered
    by ICHostViewController on the display link thread. You may handle these events
    using specialized ICNode objects or by subclassing ICScene.</li>
    <li><b>Retina display support</b>: retina display support may be enabled using
    the enableRetinaDisplaySupport: method. The class provides access to a globally
    defined content scale factor, which is set to 1 for non-retina displays or to 2
    when retina display support is enabled.</li>
    <li><b>Providing access to auxiliary managers</b>: ICHostViewController manages
    an ICTextureCache object (see textureCache property.) The texture cache is bound
    to the view controlled by the ICHostViewController instance.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Subclassing</h3>

 ICHostViewController is an abstract base class, that is it needs to be specialized for
 each supported platform. IcedCoffee currently ships with two built-in platform-specific
 subclasses: ICHostViewControllerIOS and ICHostViewControllerMac.  Depending on the
 target platform, ICHostViewController may inherit from different super classes. On
 the Mac it is a subclass of NSObject while on iOS it inherits from UIViewController.

 As a framework user, you should subclass the ICHostViewControllerIOS or
 ICHostViewControllerMac class if you require a custom view controller for managing your
 application's native OS view(s). Note, however, that in a standard application there
 usually is no need to subclass the host view controller class.

 An ICFrameUpdateMode enumerated value defining when the host view controller should draw

 host view controller draw the scene's contents continuously, synchronized with the display
 refresh rate. Setting it to kICFrameUpdateMode_OnDemand lets the host view controller draw
 the scene's contents on demand only, when one or multiple nodes' ICNode::setNeedsDisplay
 method has been called.
 
 The default value for this property is kICFrameUpdateMode_Synchronized.
 
 @remarks You should use synchronized updates for scenes that change frequently and on demand
 updates for those that change rarely. Setting the frame update mode to on demand drawing
 has effects on update messages scheduled with ICHostViewController::scheduler. Update messages
 will only be sent when a frame is acutally drawn, that is, you cannot rely on ICScheduler
 for scheduling animation updates in this case.
